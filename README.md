# COMP515 - Distributed Systems
The two folders are for assignments and Golang tutorials. These tutorials were given by our TA [Waris Gill](https://github.com/warisgill)
AWS Connection scripts usually require a secret key, which I removed of course :)
Resources for Assignment 3 were also removed because they are huge.
Assignment 2 has some major bugs to fix.
